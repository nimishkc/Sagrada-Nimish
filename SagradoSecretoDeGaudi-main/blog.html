            <h3>The Nativity Façade</h3>
            <p>
              Located on the east facing side, this intricately detailed and naturalistic façade was inspired by the “Art Nouveau” movement and is the oldest one of all. It is the only façade whose construction began during Antoni Gaudí’s lifetime.
              <br><br>
              Containing Nativity scenes from the Bible, it represents the birth and life of Jesus and is exemplified by three portals–each one representing a different virtue and member of the Holy Family: hope (for Joseph), charity (for Jesus), and faith (for the Virgin Mary)--and in this order when facing the structure. The centre portal of Charity, in honour of Jesus himself, depicts the scene of his birth, and is crowned with a cypress tree (the “tree of life”), where symbolism of the Holy Trinity (represented by a cross, an “x” and a dove) can also be identified at the atop its structure. All of the portals have been lined with rosaries and beautifully decorated with coloured bronze panels over stainless steel doors at the base of every portal.
              <br><br>
              Taking a closer look at the detailing of this façade will reveal many other natural and “life-like” design elements, with various and copious amounts of plants and animals–from lilies and cherry trees to hens and eagles, which have all depicted in celebration of Jesus’ life. Additional sculptures of shepherds and angels, moulded from ceramic and stone, can be found throughout this portion of the Basílica’s structure.
              <br><br>
              The Nativity façade also contains 4 bell towers and each one is dedicated to a different apostle: Barnabas, Simon, Jude, and Matthias (and each in that order from left to right). These towers vary in height between 98.5 and 112 metres. If you pay a visit, you can even take a lift up to St. Jude’s tower and walk across a bridge to find yourself at the tower of St. Barnabas–the only one of which Gaudí witnessed the completion of during his lifetime.

            <h3>The Passion Façade</h3>
            <p>
              Facing the western direction, this façade is incredibly distinct with its sharp, angular features and is even described as being “skeletal” in terms of its structure–very much in contrast to the natural and organic scenes of the Nativity façade. It was developed based on Gaudí’s plans from his original model, despite having been entirely constructed after his death.
              <br><br>
              As opposed to the Nativity façade, the Passion façade was designed to represent the death and resurrection of Jesus. These representations have been divided between a lower and upper narthex, or set of porches embedded within the structure, in which the lowermost part symbolises Jesus’ death, while the uppermost, his resurrection. It is a façade in which the scenes from Jesus’ final days of life have been visually represented, taking on the form of an “s” shaped journey beginning at the bottom left and transcending through the main cross at the roof of the structure to symbolise his later resurrection.
              <br><br>
              While the upper narthex has been crowned with a central cross and the Holy Spirit, surrounded by a set of angels, and embellished with a stained glass window, the lower one has additionally been divided amongst three portals. It is through these portals that you will find scenes beginning with “The Last Supper” (furthermost to the left), that continue on all the way to Jesus’ crucifixion (at the top of the very centre portal), before reaching upwards into the scene of his resurrection. The portals themselves have been separated by six columns said to resemble tree trunks, representing Jesus’ roots that have been left behind, in spite of his death. 
              <br><br>
              It is a façade imbued with a significant amount of hidden and meaningful symbolism, as can further be demonstrated by the cryptogram, or “magic square”, found next to the scene of Judas’ kiss. No matter the line of direction that the numbers are read in, their sum will always add up to 33–the age of Jesus at his death.
              <br><br>
              The Passion façade also contains 4 bell towers, each representing one of the following 4 apostles (in order from left to right): James the lesser, Bartholomew, Thomas, and Philip. These towers stand a bit taller than those of the Nativity scene, with the tallest of the towers–that of St. Thomas, standing at 90 metres in height, and can be accessed through a bridge upon first taking a lift through the tower of St. Philip.

          <h3>The Glory Façade</h3>
          <p>
            Facing the south with what is often referred to as the main entrance, is the final and only façade still under construction to this very day. It is also the only one not entirely structurally based on one of Gaudí’s models, as the time consuming development of the structure meant that he did not manage to leave more than a few general ideas behind before the end of his life. 
            <br><br>
            Even so, his ideas for it–including symbolic representations for all of humanity, from Adam and Eve down to the very Last Judgement, with themes of heaven and hell, can be found all throughout this façade’s architectural design. A group of theologians have been working hard with today’s architects to ensure that the religious meaning remains as close to Gaudí’s vision as possible.
            <br><br>
            While the Nativity and Passion façades represent Jesus’ life and death, this façade is meant to represent his “eternal glory”, or the state of the world beyond his own life. It contains main themes concerning the journey of a person’s life, with temptation through the seven deadly sins and an ultimate “ascension to God”.
            <br><br>
            It is the tallest of all the façades and will contain one “great narthex” as a part of its design, crowned with sixteen lanterns, where the seven on the bottom will represent the days of creation and the nine on top will contain groups of angels praising God. It is the only tower that will not extend down to the base of the foundation, instead being held up by eight columns representing each of the beatitudes.
            <br><br>
            As with each of the other façades, this façade will also consist of 4 bell towers upon completion, which will be dedicated to the remaining 4 apostles: Andrew, Peter, Paul, and James the Greater (spanning from left to right in that order). All four towers have yet to be constructed as a part of the structure (at the time of writing in 2024).

            <p>
              Surrounding the main central tower of Jesus, these 4 towers all stand taller than the other 12 dedicated to the apostles at 135 metres in height, and instead represent the 4 Evangelists, who have dedicated their lives to the preservation of Christianity–Matthew, Mark, John, and Luke. All 4 towers have been embellished with a unique symbolic entity, coupled with wings–further representing each of the four elements.
              <br><br>
              The tower of Luke faces the mountains and can be identified from the figure of an ox (symbolising earth) next to Mark’s tower of a lion (symbolising fire), while the other two towers can be found facing the sea, where Matthew’s tower is represented by an angel (symbolising air), and John’s with an eagle (symbolising water).
              <br><br>
              The development of these towers have only very recently been completed at the end of 2023. If you pay a visit, you will discover that each of the towers contain a set of staircases and lifts that will lead you up to a set of bridges, granting further access to Jesus’ central tower.

            <h3>The Virgin Mary Tower</h3>
            <p>
              As the second tallest tower of the Basílica, standing at 138 metres, this central tower is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and can be identified by its embellishment of a morning star, symbolic of the “Mother of God”, that rises above the structure of a twelve-point crown. The star itself is 7.5m metres wide and made of textured glass, structured within a stainless steel outline.
              <br><br>
              If you are in the area between 10-12 at night, you may even discover that the star lights up–a tradition that only began upon the tower’s inauguration in December of 2021. The design for the star itself was based off of Gaudí’s original concept for it, in which he envisioned for it to shine just bright enough at night, yet to be well visible throughout the day, as to not “dematerialize” its architectural worth and all that it represents.
              <br><br>
              You will also find that the crown and the rest of the tower light up from within, revealing an incredible amount of intricate detailing that is visible from afar, no matter where you may be staying when visiting Barcelona.

              At the centre of it all stands the main central tower, dedicated to Jesus Christ himself. It is also the tallest tower at 172.5 metres in height–well above any of the others, designed in accordance with Gaudí's original concept of hierarchically representing the divine. Under this concept, the taller the tower, the closer it or one is to God.
              <br><br>
              Aside from its height, this tower can be identified by its unique pinnacle of a “four-armed cross”, with the Lamb represented at either side and lights shining in each of the four cardinal directions. The top of this tower is symbolic of the remembrance of Jesus–referring to him as “the light of the world”.
              <br><br>
              Three levels of the tower are accessible to all those who wish to visit it–one of which is located within the pinnacle of the cross itself. 
              <br><br>
              Though currently unfinished, construction plans suggest the tower will be fully completed by 2026.

            <h3>The Crypt</h3>
            <p>
              Years before the Basílica’s construction in 1882, even before Antoni Gaudí had joined for the construction of the main cathedral, the Crypt was developed by Francisco de Paula del Villar as the first part of the initial Temple project. 
              <br><br>
              When Gaudí took over, he maintained the “neo-Gothic” design of the main structure, yet added a set of spiral staircases, connecting the Crypt to what is now the main structure of the cathedral. He also added a series of stained glass windows upon digging out the surrounding soil, allowing in some natural light. His contribution to the Crypt further included implementing various decorative and symbolic elements, such as keystones and religious furnishings, ultimately completing this part of the project in 1889.
              <br><br>
              Today, the Crypt lies 10 metres underneath what is now the foundation of the Basílica, along with Antoni Gaudí himself within it, who was buried at this very location in 1926.
